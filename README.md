# seqclone
seqclone is an algorithm which identified genes expression that are inherited by clones during differentiation. These genes could become targets for further functional studies and have been useful for quantifying the extent of clonal effects in differentiation. 
# approach 
It implements the approach described here:
   - https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800481

but does so in Python, on a transcriptomic scale, using single-cell RNA seq data (although any other data in AnnData format should work)

If you'd like to use this approach, please reach out, I'm happy to help.
